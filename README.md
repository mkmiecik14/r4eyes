# r4eyes

.RProfile file that saves your eyes from excessive strain due to programming!

My optometrist recommended that every 20 minutes I look away from the computer screen to take a break for 20 seconds and look at something at least 20 feet away. I found this advice difficult to implement, as 20 minutes would go by and I would often forget.

With this `.Rprofile` file, the reminders are automatic and print every 20 minutes to your console.

Happy programming in R!
